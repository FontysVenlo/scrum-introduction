## What is AGILE?

- Feedback<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

What does it mean if somebody says, he works agile or uses an agile process?
**Time focused**, usually using Time Boxing: Do not exceed time given for meetings.
**Iterative**, doing the work in iterations, for instance, doing analysis, design, implementation and testing again and again.
**Incremental product development** means creating **small pieces** of functionality and thus
Developing these small pieces
The most important thing in agile is the **feedback part**.

## Agile Manifesto 

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Working software over comprehensive documentation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Responding to change over following a plan<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- n -->

So what all these agile processes have in common is that they follow the 12 principles of the agile manifesto. This manifesto was developed by some guys, e.g. Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), Ron Jeffries (Creator of Spring), Alistair Cockburn (Use Case Expert), Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland… asf.  

### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Individuals are more important than processes and tools. The people are doing the work.

### Working software over comprehensive documentation

This does not mean that documentation work should be skipped. It means that only the documentation which is necessary must and should be created. E.g. if 

### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Have the customer on-board. The customer should work with the team together instead of insisting on contractual parts which can and mainly will change. 

### Responding to change over following a plan

Be able to handle changes - better - embrace changes. Projects will change thus managing changes well means managing the project well. 

## 12 Principles

The 12 principles are based on the Agile Manifesto.

- 1  - Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

- 2 - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

- 3 - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- 4 - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- 5 - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

- 6 - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

- 7 - Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- 8 - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- 9 - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- 10 - Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

- 11 - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- 12 - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
